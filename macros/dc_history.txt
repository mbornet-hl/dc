3.4. Languages
Almost everybody in the group has done languages. Thompson and Ritchie built assemblers from
scratch. On the tiny PDP-7 the assembler was supplemented by tmg, Doug McIlroy’s version of Bob
McClure’s compiler-compiler. Using it Thompson wrote B, the evolutionary link between Martin
Richards’s (Cambridge University) BCPL and C. The PDP-11 assembler,adesk calculator dc, and B itself
were written in B to bootstrap the system to the PDP-11. Because it could run before the disk had arrived,
dc—not the assembler—became the first language to run on our PDP-11. Soon revised to handle arbitraryprecision numbers (v1), dc was taken over by Bob Morris and Lorinda Cherry. It now ranks as the senior
language on UNIX systems.
